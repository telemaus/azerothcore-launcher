## Windows Defender SmartScreen Warning

When installing the application, you may see a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen saying "Windows protected your PC" or "Unknown publisher". 

**The application is digitally signed with a self-signed certificate for security, but Windows may still show warnings for applications not signed with expensive commercial certificates.**

**The application is safe to install. To proceed:**
1. Click "More info" on the warning dialog
2. Click "Run anyway" 
3. The application will install normally

### Why do I see this warning?

- The application is code-signed with a self-signed certificate (which provides integrity verification)
- Commercial code-signing certificates cost $300+ per year, which isn't practical for free open-source projects
- Windows prioritizes applications signed with expensive commercial certificates from Certificate Authorities
- The application is open-source and you can review all code on GitHub for complete transparency
